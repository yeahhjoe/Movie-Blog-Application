# Movie-Blog-Application
 Welcome to the MovieTrailers and Reviews web application! This project utilizes Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB to create a platform where users can view movie trailers and write reviews for the movies they've seen. The application leverages API calls to interact with a Spring Boot backend that fetches and stores movie data in a MongoDB database.

Features

Write Movie Reviews: Users can write and submit reviews for movies they have watched.
Backend API: Spring Boot serves as the backend API, providing endpoints for retrieving movie data and managing reviews.
Database Storage: MongoDB is used to store movie information and user reviews.
Technologies Used

Frontend:
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
react-material-ui-carousel: A carousel component for displaying movie trailers.
react-player: A component for playing video content.
react-bootstrap: A library of reusable UI components.
Backend:
